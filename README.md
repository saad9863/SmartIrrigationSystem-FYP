# SmartIrrigationSystem-FYP

• Programmed on Arduino taking analog inputs from sensors.
• Utilizes GSM(SIM900A) communicated serially with Arduino for real-time data feedback on Thing speak.
• Water flow regulation based on multiple sensors using a custom-made motorized ball valve controlled using Pulse Modulated Wave (PWM) utilizing the servo library offered by Arduino IDE
• Cost-Effective Valve Design to reduce costs by 92.65%.
